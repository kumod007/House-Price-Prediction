<h2>📝 Project Objective 📝 </h2>

* The aim of this project is to <b>train a Machine Learning Model</b> which can predict the <b>House Sale Price</b> using relevant features.<br>
* This project is completely based for <b>House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques</b> Kaggle Competition.<br>
* With <b>79 explanatory variables</b> describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges us to predict the final price of each home.<br>
